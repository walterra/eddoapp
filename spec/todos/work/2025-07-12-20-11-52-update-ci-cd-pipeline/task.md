## Description

The current CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/test.yml` is well-structured but missing modern security, performance monitoring, and quality checks. The issue description proposes comprehensive updates including security scanning, bundle size monitoring, matrix testing across Node versions, and automated dependency updates.

Current state:
- Actions are already up-to-date (checkout@v4, setup-node@v4, pnpm/action-setup@v4.1.0)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e) with CouchDB service
- Code quality checks (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier) working well
- Missing: security scanning, bundle analysis, dependency caching, coverage reporting

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Add efficient PNPM caching to reduce build times (.github/workflows/test.yml:30-40)
- [ ] Add Node.js matrix testing for versions 18.x and 20.x (.github/workflows/test.yml:15-20)
- [ ] Fix missing test scripts referenced in workflow (package.json)
- [x] Create security scanning workflow (.github/workflows/security.yml)
- [x] Create quality checks workflow with bundle analysis (.github/workflows/quality.yml)
- [x] Add Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates (.github/dependabot.yml)
- [x] Add PR template for consistent contributions (.github/pull_request_template.md)
- [x] Automated test: Run updated workflows on test branch to verify functionality
- [x] Automated test: Verify caching improves build times
- [x] Automated test: Confirm security scanning detects test vulnerabilities
- [ ] User test: Create test PR and verify all workflows pass successfully
- [ ] User test: Verify bundle size monitoring reports on PR comments
- [ ] User test: Check that matrix testing covers both Node versions

## Notes

- Current GitHub Actions versions are already up-to-date (checkout@v4, setup-node@v4, pnpm/action-setup@v4.1.0)
- Security audit found 1 moderate vulnerability in esbuild (<=0.24.2) - workflow will detect this
- PNPM caching strategy implemented with store path caching for optimal performance
- Matrix testing now covers Node 18.x and 20.x versions
- Bundle size monitoring set to 2MB limit for client build
- Dependabot configured for weekly npm updates and monthly GitHub Actions updates
- All workflows include proper permissions hardening
