## Original Todo

- make an ASCII eddo logo

## Description

Create a small ASCII art logo for "Eddo" to replace the current `<h1>Eddo</h1>` heading in the web client, giving it a retro aesthetic. The ASCII logo should be displayed as a pre-formatted text element that maintains the ASCII art formatting while fitting well within the existing page layout.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Find the PageWrapper.tsx component that contains the h1 "Eddo" title (packages/web-client/src/components/PageWrapper.tsx)
- [ ] Draft several ASCII logo variations in the Notes section below (small, fits in ~4-6 lines)
- [ ] Get user approval on preferred ASCII logo design
- [ ] Replace the h1 element with a pre element containing the chosen ASCII logo
- [ ] Apply appropriate styling to make it look good (monospace font, proper spacing)
- [ ] Ensure the ASCII logo is responsive and looks good on mobile
- [ ] Automated test: Verify the component renders without errors
- [ ] User test: View the web client and confirm the ASCII logo displays correctly
- [ ] User test: Check that the logo looks good on different screen sizes

## Notes

ASCII logo variations will be drafted here for review.
