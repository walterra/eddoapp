## Original Todo

- read dev/ISSUE-036-security-audit-pipeline.md and check if this still needs to be done. check if this is covered by the work done in the branch `feature/update-ci-cd-pipeline`

## Description

This task involves analyzing whether the comprehensive security audit pipeline defined in ISSUE-036 has been fully implemented by the work in the `feature/update-ci-cd-pipeline` branch. The investigation shows that most core security features have been implemented (dependency scanning, CodeQL analysis, automated updates, security workflows), but some components from the original plan may still be missing, such as secrets detection with TruffleHog, license compliance checking, and the security policy documentation.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Compare implemented features against original ISSUE-036 requirements (analysis task)
- [ ] Identify missing security components from original plan
- [ ] Document current security audit coverage in project documentation  
- [ ] Create summary report of what was implemented vs. what remains
- [ ] Automated test: Verify security workflows are properly configured and functional
- [ ] User test: Review the comparison analysis and decide if additional work is needed
