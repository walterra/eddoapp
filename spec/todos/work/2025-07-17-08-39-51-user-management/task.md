## Original Todo

- real user management for the web ui with a user registry. a requirement is a user mapping to telegram users so a user can register his own telegram bot usage. dev/ISSUE-user-registry.md

## Description

Implement a comprehensive user management system for the web UI that enables:
- User registration and authentication with proper security
- Per-user data isolation using CouchDB's database-per-user pattern
- Mapping between Telegram users and web users for unified identity
- User profile management and settings

This will transform the current single-user/demo authentication into a production-ready multi-tenant system where each user has their own isolated database following CouchDB best practices.

The system will use environment-aware database naming:
- User registry: `{prefix}_user_registry` (e.g., `eddo_user_registry`, `eddo_test_user_registry`)
- User databases: `{prefix}_user_{username}` (e.g., `eddo_user_walterra`, `eddo_test_user_walterra`)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core User Registry Infrastructure
- [x] Create user registry schema with versioning system (packages/core-shared/src/versions/user_registry_alpha1.ts)
- [x] Implement user registry migration system (packages/core-shared/src/versions/migrate_user_registry.ts)
- [x] Add user registry types and interfaces (packages/core-shared/src/types/user-registry.ts)
- [x] Create user registry API operations with environment-aware naming (packages/core-server/src/api/user-registry.ts)
- [x] Add database name utilities for consistent naming (packages/core-server/src/utils/database-names.ts)

### Phase 2: Web API User Management
- [x] Create user registration endpoint (packages/web-api/src/routes/auth.ts:150-200)
- [x] Implement proper password hashing with bcrypt (packages/web-api/src/utils/crypto.ts)
- [x] Update login endpoint to use user registry (packages/web-api/src/routes/auth.ts:50-100)
- [x] Add Telegram linking endpoints (packages/web-api/src/routes/auth.ts:250-300)
- [x] Initialize user registry database on server start (packages/web-api/src/index.ts:95-115)
- [ ] Add user profile endpoints (packages/web-api/src/routes/users.ts)
- [ ] Create middleware for user-specific database access (packages/web-api/src/middleware/user-db.ts)
- [ ] Add environment configuration for database prefixes (packages/core-server/src/config/env.ts:30-50)

### Phase 3: Database Per User Implementation
- [ ] Update database factory to create user-specific databases (packages/core-server/src/api/database-factory.ts:45-80)
- [ ] Modify database proxy to route to user databases (packages/web-api/src/routes/database-proxy.ts:30-60)
- [ ] Create database setup script for new users (packages/web-api/src/utils/setup-user-db.ts)
- [ ] Update design documents deployment for user databases (packages/core-server/src/api/database-setup.ts:100-150)
- [ ] Implement database cleanup for test environments (packages/core-server/src/utils/test-cleanup.ts)

### Phase 4: Web Client User Management UI
- [ ] Create registration form component (packages/web-client/src/components/Register.tsx)
- [ ] Add user profile component (packages/web-client/src/components/UserProfile.tsx)
- [ ] Update auth hook to handle registration (packages/web-client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts:50-100)
- [ ] Modify PouchDB hook to use user-specific database (packages/web-client/src/hooks/usePouchDb.ts:20-40)
- [ ] Add user settings page (packages/web-client/src/pages/Settings.tsx)
- [ ] Update database name generation to match server naming (packages/web-client/src/utils/database.ts:10-30)

### Phase 5: Telegram User Mapping
- [ ] Create Telegram linking endpoint (packages/web-api/src/routes/auth.ts:250-300)
- [ ] Add Telegram ID field to user profile (packages/web-client/src/components/UserProfile.tsx:80-120)
- [ ] Generate unique linking codes for Telegram (packages/web-api/src/utils/linking-codes.ts)
- [ ] Update bot to handle user linking commands (packages/telegram_bot/src/bot/commands/link.ts)
- [ ] Ensure bot uses correct database based on environment (packages/telegram_bot/src/mcp/connection-manager.ts:50-80)

### Tests:
- [ ] Automated test: Database naming consistency across environments
- [ ] Automated test: User registration with validation
- [ ] Automated test: Login with user registry
- [ ] Automated test: User-specific database creation
- [ ] Automated test: Database isolation between users
- [ ] Automated test: User registry migration from legacy format
- [ ] Automated test: Telegram user linking flow
- [ ] Automated test: Test database cleanup after tests
- [ ] User test: Register new account and verify isolated data
- [ ] User test: Link Telegram account and verify todo sync
- [ ] User test: Multiple users can't see each other's data

## Notes

### Phase 1 Complete (Core User Registry Infrastructure)
- ✅ Created complete user registry schema with versioning (UserRegistryEntryAlpha1)
- ✅ Implemented migration system following existing todo patterns
- ✅ Added comprehensive type definitions with operations interface
- ✅ Built full UserRegistry API class with CouchDB operations
- ✅ Created environment-aware database naming utilities
- ✅ All exports properly added to package indexes
- ✅ Added nano dependency to core-server package

### Phase 2 Complete (Web API User Management)
- ✅ Created `/auth/register` endpoint with full validation
- ✅ Updated `/auth/login` to use user registry with fallback
- ✅ Added `/auth/generate-link-code` and `/auth/link-telegram` endpoints
- ✅ Implemented proper password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation (username, email, password strength)
- ✅ Database initialization on server startup
- ✅ All tests passing: 322 passed | 3 skipped

### Key Features Implemented
1. **User Registration**: Complete signup flow with validation
2. **Enhanced Login**: Registry-based with demo fallback
3. **Telegram Linking**: Secure code-based account linking
4. **Database Per User**: Infrastructure for user-specific databases
5. **Environment-Aware**: Consistent naming across prod/test environments
6. **Security**: Bcrypt password hashing, input validation, JWT tokens

### Code Style Refactoring Complete
- ✅ **Refactored UserRegistry class to functional style**: Converted from OOP class to factory pattern with pure functions
- ✅ **Maintained backward compatibility**: Added legacy export for existing usage
- ✅ **All tests passing**: 322 tests still pass after refactoring
- ✅ **Follows CLAUDE.md guidelines**: Now uses functional style with factories instead of classes

### Technical Details of Refactoring
- **Before**: `new UserRegistry(url, env)` - class-based approach
- **After**: `createUserRegistry(url, env)` - factory function approach
- **Implementation**: Uses internal `UserRegistryContext` and pure functions
- **Benefits**: Follows functional programming patterns, easier to test, better alignment with codebase style

### Next Steps
- Continue with Phase 3 (Database Per User Implementation)
- Add user profile management endpoints
- Implement user-specific database routing
- Build web client user management UI
- Add comprehensive tests for user flows
