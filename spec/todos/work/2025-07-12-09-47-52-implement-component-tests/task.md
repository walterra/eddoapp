## Original Todo

- work on dev/ISSUE-024-implement-component-tests.md

## Description

The project currently has zero component test coverage despite having excellent infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library. While utility functions and server integration tests are comprehensive, all major React components (`TodoBoard`, `AddTodo`, `TodoListElement`, etc.) lack tests, creating significant risk for regressions.

The goal is to implement a comprehensive component test suite covering:
- Core business logic components (todo management, time tracking)
- PouchDB integration and error handling 
- User interactions and accessibility
- Form validation and state management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Missing Dependencies (Week 1)

- [ ] Add missing testing dependencies (`@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`) (packages/client/package.json)
- [ ] Create test setup file for React Testing Library with PouchDB mocks (packages/client/src/test-setup.ts)
- [ ] Create component test utilities and data factories (packages/client/src/test-utils.tsx)
- [ ] Test core PouchDB context and hooks (packages/client/src/pouch_db.test.ts)
- [ ] Test useDatabaseChanges hook with real-time updates (packages/client/src/hooks/use_database_changes.test.tsx)

### Phase 2: Core Business Components (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Test AddTodo component - form validation, submission, error handling (packages/client/src/components/add_todo.test.tsx)
- [ ] Test TodoListElement component - checkbox, time tracking, modal triggers (packages/client/src/components/todo_list_element.test.tsx)  
- [ ] Test TodoEditModal component - form editing, save/delete, repeat todos (packages/client/src/components/todo_edit_modal.test.tsx)
- [ ] Test TodoBoard component - data fetching, filtering, error states (packages/client/src/components/todo_board.test.tsx)

### Phase 3: Supporting Components and Integration (Week 2)

- [ ] Test tag management components (tag_input, tag_filter, tag_display) (packages/client/src/components/tag_*.test.tsx)
- [ ] Test database error handling components (database_error_fallback, database_error_message) (packages/client/src/components/database_error_*.test.tsx)
- [ ] Test remaining hooks (use_database_health, use_tags, use_sync_dev) (packages/client/src/hooks/*.test.ts)
- [ ] Automated test: Run full test suite and achieve â‰¥80% component coverage
- [ ] User test: Verify all major component interactions work correctly with comprehensive manual testing
