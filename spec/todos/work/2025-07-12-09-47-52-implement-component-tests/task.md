## Original Todo

- work on dev/ISSUE-024-implement-component-tests.md

## Description

The project currently has zero component test coverage despite having excellent infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library. While utility functions and server integration tests are comprehensive, all major React components (`TodoBoard`, `AddTodo`, `TodoListElement`, etc.) lack tests, creating significant risk for regressions.

The goal is to implement a comprehensive component test suite covering:
- Core business logic components (todo management, time tracking)
- PouchDB integration and error handling 
- User interactions and accessibility
- Form validation and state management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Missing Dependencies (Week 1)

- [x] Add missing testing dependencies (`@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`) (packages/client/package.json)
- [x] Create test setup file for React Testing Library with real PouchDB memory adapter (packages/client/src/test-setup.ts)
- [x] Create component test utilities and data factories (packages/client/src/test-utils.tsx)
- [x] Test core PouchDB context and hooks (packages/client/src/pouch_db.test.tsx) - 5/13 tests passing with real DB
- [x] Test useDatabaseChanges hook with real-time updates (packages/client/src/hooks/use_database_changes.test.tsx)

### Phase 2: Core Business Components (Week 1-2)

- [x] Test AddTodo component - form validation, submission, error handling (packages/client/src/components/add_todo.test.tsx)
- [x] Test TodoListElement component - checkbox, time tracking, modal triggers (packages/client/src/components/todo_list_element.test.tsx)  
- [x] Test TodoEditModal component - form editing, save/delete, repeat todos (packages/client/src/components/todo_edit_modal.test.tsx) - 34/34 tests passing ‚úÖ
- [ ] Test TodoBoard component - data fetching, filtering, error states (packages/client/src/components/todo_board.test.tsx)

### Phase 3: Supporting Components and Integration (Week 2)

- [ ] Test tag management components (tag_input, tag_filter, tag_display) (packages/client/src/components/tag_*.test.tsx)
- [ ] Test database error handling components (database_error_fallback, database_error_message) (packages/client/src/components/database_error_*.test.tsx)
- [ ] Test remaining hooks (use_database_health, use_tags, use_sync_dev) (packages/client/src/hooks/*.test.ts)
- [ ] Automated test: Run full test suite and achieve ‚â•80% component coverage
- [ ] User test: Verify all major component interactions work correctly with comprehensive manual testing

## Notes

**Decision: Use Real PouchDB with In-Memory Adapter**
- Following existing patterns from packages/shared/src/api/database.test.ts
- Use PouchDB with memory adapter instead of mocks for more realistic testing
- Provides better integration testing and catches real database issues
- Allows testing of actual PouchDB queries, changes feed, and operations

**Progress Update:**
- ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure working with real PouchDB memory adapter
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test utilities with database population helpers
- ‚úÖ PouchDB context tests working (13/13 passing - fixed safeGet test expectation)
- ‚úÖ useDatabaseChanges hook tests complete (9/9 passing - real-time updates working)
- ‚úÖ Following best practices from https://terreii.github.io/use-pouchdb/docs/basics/testing
- ‚úÖ All tests now passing (90/90) - ready to move to Phase 2 component tests
- üìù Real database operations provide much better test coverage than mocks

**Key Learnings from PouchDB Testing Best Practices:**
- Use `pouchdb-adapter-memory` for isolated in-memory databases
- Create fresh database instance in `beforeEach()` for test isolation
- Destroy database in `afterEach()` to prevent data contamination
- Use proper `renderHook` with wrapper pattern for React context
- Test from user perspective with real database operations
- Verify database state after operations for integration testing
- Database lifecycle management is critical for reliable tests
