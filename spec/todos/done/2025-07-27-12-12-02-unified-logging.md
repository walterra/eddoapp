## Original Todo

web client and web api have logging via `pnpm dev`. we need the same for the mcp server `pnpm dev:mcp-server` and telegram bot `pnpm dev:telegram-bot`. they should all log to the same log files for easy access via `pnpm logs:*` commands.

## Description

The current `pnpm dev` command provides unified logging for web-client and web-api services using `npm-run-all` with timestamped output and service labels. We need to extend this unified logging system to the existing `pnpm dev:mcp-server` and `pnpm dev:telegram-bot` commands so they also log to the same timestamped log files.

**Current State:**
- `pnpm dev` runs web-client + web-api with unified logging to `logs/dev-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- `pnpm dev:mcp-server` and `pnpm dev:telegram-bot` run independently without unified logging
- Existing `pnpm logs:tail`, `logs:follow`, `logs:list` commands work with current unified logs

**Goal:**
- **Keep `pnpm dev` unchanged** - still runs only web-client + web-api
- **Modify existing `pnpm dev:mcp-server` and `pnpm dev:telegram-bot`** to include unified logging
- All services should use the same log format with timestamps and service labels when run individually
- Existing log management commands should work with all unified logs
- Preserve the ability to run services individually with unified logging

## Notes

The unified logging scripts were already implemented in package.json:92-93. Both services now use the exact same logging pipeline as the main `pnpm dev` command:

- Timestamped output with format `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`
- Service labels `[mcp-server]` and `[telegram-bot]`
- Color preservation with `FORCE_COLOR=1`
- Dual output (console + log file) with `tee`
- Compatible file naming: `logs/mcp-server-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` and `logs/telegram-bot-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`

All existing `pnpm logs:*` commands work seamlessly with the new log files.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Modify `dev:mcp-server` script in root package.json to include unified logging pipeline (package.json:92)
- [x] Modify `dev:telegram-bot` script in root package.json to include unified logging pipeline (package.json:93)
- [x] Test `pnpm dev:mcp-server` command produces timestamped logs in logs/ directory
- [x] Test `pnpm dev:telegram-bot` command produces timestamped logs in logs/ directory  
- [x] Automated test: Verify log files are created with correct naming pattern
- [x] Automated test: Verify existing `pnpm logs:*` commands work with new log files
- [x] User test: Run `pnpm dev:mcp-server` and verify output appears both in console and log file
- [x] User test: Run `pnpm dev:telegram-bot` and verify output appears both in console and log file
- [x] User test: Run `pnpm logs:tail` and verify it shows most recent log from any service
