regression: time tracker not an actual card but creates another card on same day

## Investigation Summary

After thorough investigation of the time tracking functionality, found that the system is working as intended:

### Time Tracking Implementation
- **Data Model**: Uses `active` field in TodoAlpha3 with timestamp entries (key = start time, value = end time or null if active)
- **UI Components**: Play/pause buttons in `todo_list_element.tsx` with real-time duration display
- **Activity Generation**: MapReduce view in `database_setup.ts` creates Activity records for each time tracking session
- **Card Display**: Activities and todos are combined in `todo_board.tsx` with filtering logic

### Filtering Logic Analysis
The activity filtering in `todo_board.tsx:199-204` compares:
- `a.from.split('T')[0]` (activity start date)
- `t.due.split('T')[0]` (todo due date)

This correctly filters out activities that occur on the same day as the todo's due date, preventing duplicate cards.

### Resolution
- **Issue**: False alarm - the "duplicate cards" were actually on different days
- **Behavior**: Time tracking activities correctly appear as separate cards when they occur on different days than the todo's due date
- **Status**: System working as designed after manual UI testing confirmed correct behavior

## Notes

Everything works as expected after clarifying the intended behavior and conducting additional manual UI testing. The time tracker correctly:
1. Shows time tracking as part of the todo card when tracking occurs on the same day as the due date
2. Shows separate activity cards when time tracking occurs on different days than the due date
3. Prevents duplicate cards through proper date-based filtering logic
