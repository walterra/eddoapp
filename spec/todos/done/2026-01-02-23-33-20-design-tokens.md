**GitHub Issue:** [#351](https://github.com/walterra/eddoapp/issues/351)

## Description

Create a centralized design token system in Tailwind CSS v4 to replace arbitrary values with consistent, semantic tokens. This establishes the foundation for all future design work.

**Success Criteria:**

- All design values come from a defined token system
- Typography hierarchy is clear and intentional
- Color palette is semantic (primary, neutral, success/warning/error, accent)
- Spacing scale follows 4px base unit
- Inter font integrated for professional typography

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Inter font dependency

- [x] Code change: Add `@fontsource-variable/inter` to `packages/web-client/package.json`
- [x] Code change: Import Inter font in `packages/web-client/src/design-tokens.css`

### 2. Define design tokens in CSS (Tailwind v4 approach)

- [x] Code change: Create `packages/web-client/src/design-tokens.css` with:
  - Typography scale (7 sizes: xs, sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)
  - Spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
  - Semantic color palette (primary, neutral, success, warning, error, accent)
  - Line height tokens (1.5-1.6 for readability)
  - Font family configuration (Inter as primary)
- [x] Code change: Import design-tokens.css in `packages/web-client/src/eddo.css`

### 3. Configure Tailwind theme extension

- [x] Code change: Use @theme directive for Tailwind v4 in design-tokens.css
- [x] Code change: Update body styles to use semantic tokens

### 4. Create documentation

- [x] Code change: Create `packages/web-client/src/DESIGN_TOKENS.md` documenting the token system

### 5. Verification

- [x] Automated test: Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)
- [x] Automated test: Lint passes (`pnpm lint`)
- [x] Automated test: TypeScript check passes (`pnpm tsc:check`)
- [x] User test: Verify tokens are available in Tailwind classes
- [x] User test: Verify Inter font loads correctly in browser

## Review

- [x] Code review: design-tokens.css properly structured with @theme directive
- [x] Code review: Semantic aliases use :root for dark mode compatibility
- [x] Code review: Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- [x] No bugs or edge cases identified
- [x] Dark mode regression fixed (semantic aliases moved outside @theme)

## Notes

**Current state analysis:**

- Tailwind v4 is in use with CSS-based configuration (`@import 'tailwindcss'`)
- Flowbite/Flowbite-React is used as component library
- Current CSS has basic dark mode support via `prefers-color-scheme`
- No font is explicitly configured (uses browser defaults, except monospace for Kanban)
- Colors used are arbitrary Tailwind defaults (gray-400, blue-600, etc.)
- Spacing is ad-hoc (p-0.5, p-1, p-2, px-2, py-1, gap-0.5, etc.)

**Tailwind v4 approach:**

- Uses `@theme` directive in CSS for custom properties
- Tokens defined as CSS custom properties become available as Tailwind classes
- No need for separate tailwind.config.js theme extension in v4
