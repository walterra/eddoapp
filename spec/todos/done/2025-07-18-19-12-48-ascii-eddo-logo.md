## Original Todo

- make an ASCII eddo logo

## Description

Create a small ASCII art logo for "Eddo" to replace the current `<h1>Eddo</h1>` heading in the web client, giving it a retro aesthetic. The ASCII logo should be displayed as a pre-formatted text element that maintains the ASCII art formatting while fitting well within the existing page layout.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Find the PageWrapper.tsx component that contains the h1 "Eddo" title (packages/web-client/src/components/page_wrapper.tsx:45)
- [x] Draft several ASCII logo variations in the Notes section below (small, fits in ~4-6 lines)
- [x] Get user approval on preferred ASCII logo design
- [x] Replace the h1 element with a pre element containing the chosen ASCII logo
- [x] Apply appropriate styling to make it look good (monospace font, proper spacing)
- [x] Ensure the ASCII logo is responsive and looks good on mobile
- [x] Automated test: Verify the component renders without errors
- [x] Improve accessibility with proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
- [ ] User test: View the web client and confirm the ASCII logo displays correctly
- [ ] User test: Check that the logo looks good on different screen sizes

## Notes

Implementation findings:

- Successfully replaced h1 "Eddo" with ASCII logo in packages/web-client/src/components/page_wrapper.tsx:45-54
- Used pre element with TailwindCSS classes: `m-0 p-0 font-mono text-sm leading-tight`
- Added accessibility improvements:
  - Hidden h1 with `sr-only` class for screen readers
  - Added `aria-label="Eddo logo"` for descriptive text
  - Added `role="img"` to identify ASCII art as an image
- All linting, TypeScript, and build checks passed
- ASCII logo is responsive due to small size and monospace font
