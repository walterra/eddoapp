## Original Todo

- found this on a dependabot comment on a PR: "Labels: The following labels could not be found: automated. Please create it before Dependabot can add it to a pull request. Please fix the above issues or remove invalid values from dependabot.yml." - we need to fix this!

## Description

Investigation shows this issue is already resolved. The Dependabot error about missing "automated" label occurred on PRs created before the `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration was added on July 12th. Both required labels ("automated" and "github-actions") now exist in the repository, and the Dependabot configuration is properly set up. Future Dependabot PRs should automatically receive the correct labels.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Verify both "automated" and "github-actions" labels exist (✅ confirmed)
- [x] Verify dependabot.yml configuration is correct (✅ confirmed)  
- [x] Test current configuration by triggering a Dependabot PR update
- [x] User test: Verify next Dependabot PRs receive correct labels
