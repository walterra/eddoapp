# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be kind. Be inclusive. Assume good intent.

## My Commitment

This project welcomes everyone - regardless of experience level, background, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

We do not welcome those who don't share this commitment. If you think of "woke" as an insult, dismiss inclusion efforts, or hold views rooted in hatred or supremacy - this isn't the place for you.

## Expected Behavior

- Use inclusive language
- Critique ideas, not people
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Help newcomers get started
- When frustrated, step away before responding

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Personal attacks or offensive comments
- Trolling or deliberate disruption
- Publishing others' private information

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, reach out to me privately. I'll handle it with discretion and won't retaliate against good-faith reports.

## The Spirit of Things

There's a human on the other side of every interaction. Let's make this a place where everyone feels they belong.
