# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be kind. Be inclusive. Assume good intent.

## Our Commitment

This project welcomes everyone - regardless of experience level, background, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Expected Behavior

- Use inclusive language
- Critique ideas, not people
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Help newcomers get started
- When frustrated, step away before responding

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Personal attacks or offensive comments
- Trolling or deliberate disruption
- Publishing others' private information

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, reach out to me privately. I'll handle it with discretion and won't retaliate against good-faith reports.

## The Spirit of Things

There's a human on the other side of every interaction. Let's make this a place where everyone feels they belong.
