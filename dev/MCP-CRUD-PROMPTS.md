## Available Natural Language Triggers

The application responds to these types of natural language requests:

1. **CREATE**: "Create a todo...", "Add a new task...", "Make a todo..."
2. **READ**: 
   - "Show me todos...", "List all...", "What todos do I have..."
   - "Which todos are being tracked?", "Show active time tracking"
3. **UPDATE**: 
   - "Update todo...", "Change the todo...", "Modify..."
   - "Mark as complete", "Mark as done", "Complete this todo"
4. **DELETE**: "Delete todo...", "Remove the todo...", "Get rid of..."
5. **TIME TRACKING**: 
   - "Start tracking time on...", "Begin timing..."
   - "Stop time tracking", "End timer for..."

## Data Context Understanding

The AI assistant understands these todo properties:
- **Title**: The main todo text
- **Context**: GTD-style contexts (work, private, etc.)
- **Due date**: When the todo should be completed
- **Description**: Additional details about the todo
- **Link**: Associated URL or reference
- **Repeat**: How often the todo repeats (in days)
- **Tags**: Categorization labels
- **Completion status**: Whether the todo is done
- **Time tracking**: Active timing sessions by category

## Natural Language Features

- Flexible date parsing ("June 20th", "next Friday", "in 3 days")
- Context inference from keywords ("work meeting" â†’ work context)
- Batch operations ("create these todos...")
- Status queries ("what's due today?", "show overdue items")
- Time tracking management ("start timer", "how long have I been working on this?")
