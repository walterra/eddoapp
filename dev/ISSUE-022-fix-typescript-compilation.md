# ISSUE-001: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** Build Stability  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Impact:** High - Blocks all builds and deployments  

## Description

TypeScript compilation is currently failing with 9 errors in `todo_board.tsx`, preventing successful builds and blocking the CI/CD pipeline.

## Current Status

- Build command `pnpm build` fails due to TypeScript errors
- Development server still works but with compilation warnings
- Production deployment is blocked
- CI/CD pipeline fails at build step

## Root Cause Analysis

The errors appear to be related to:
- Type mismatches in component props
- Missing type annotations
- Potential issues with PouchDB type definitions
- React event handler type issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] `pnpm build` completes successfully
- [ ] `pnpm tsc:check` passes without errors
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline builds successfully
- [ ] No new TypeScript errors introduced

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify specific errors**
   ```bash
   pnpm tsc:check --noEmit
   ```

2. **Fix type issues in todo_board.tsx**
   - Review prop interfaces
   - Add missing type annotations
   - Fix event handler types

3. **Verify PouchDB type definitions**
   - Check if @types/pouchdb-browser is up to date
   - Ensure proper type imports

4. **Test compilation**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm tsc:check
   ```

5. **Verify CI/CD pipeline**
   - Push changes and verify GitHub Actions pass
   - Ensure no regression in other files

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Local build passes
- [ ] TypeScript check passes
- [ ] CI/CD build succeeds
- [ ] No functional regressions in development

## Dependencies

None - this is a blocking issue that should be resolved first.

## Definition of Done

- TypeScript compilation completes without errors
- Build process succeeds locally and in CI
- No functional regressions introduced
- Code review completed and approved
