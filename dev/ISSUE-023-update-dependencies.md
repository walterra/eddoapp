# ISSUE-002: Update Dependencies to Latest Stable Versions

**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** Security  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Impact:** High - Security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues  

## Description

Multiple dependencies are outdated and contain potential security vulnerabilities. Core dependencies need updating to latest stable versions.

## Current Vulnerable Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- `react` ^18.2.0 → should be 18.3.x
- `@types/react` ^18.0.21 → should match React version
- `typescript` ^4.8.3 → should be 5.x
- `vite` ^3.1.3 → should be 5.x

### Development Dependencies
- `@types/node` version needs verification
- `eslint` and related plugins may need updates
- `vitest` 0.23.4 → should be latest stable

## Security Risk Assessment

- **High Risk:** TypeScript 4.x has known security issues resolved in 5.x
- **Medium Risk:** React 18.2.0 missing security patches from 18.3.x
- **Medium Risk:** Vite 3.x missing performance and security improvements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest stable versions
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] All existing functionality works correctly
- [ ] Build and test processes continue to work
- [ ] Security audit passes (`npm audit` or equivalent)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit current dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm audit
   pnpm outdated
   ```

2. **Update package.json systematically**
   - Start with patch versions
   - Then minor versions
   - Finally major versions (with breaking change review)

3. **Test core functionality after each major update**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Handle breaking changes**
   - Review migration guides for major version updates
   - Update TypeScript configuration if needed for v5
   - Update Vite configuration for v5
   - Fix any API changes

5. **Update type definitions**
   - Ensure @types packages match runtime versions
   - Fix any new TypeScript errors

6. **Run comprehensive testing**
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   pnpm lint
   pnpm tsc:check
   pnpm build
   ```

## Breaking Changes to Address

### TypeScript 4.x → 5.x
- Review new strict checks
- Update tsconfig.json if needed
- Fix any new compilation errors

### Vite 3.x → 5.x
- Review vite.config.ts compatibility
- Update any plugin configurations
- Test dev server and build process

### React 18.2 → 18.3
- Generally backwards compatible
- Test for any subtle behavior changes

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Build process works correctly
- [ ] Development server starts without issues
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Manual testing of core user flows

## Dependencies

Should be completed after ISSUE-001 (TypeScript compilation fix) to avoid compounding issues.

## Rollback Plan

- Keep backup of current package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml
- Test each major version update individually
- Have rollback commits ready for each stage

## Definition of Done

- All dependencies at latest stable versions
- Security audit shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- All tests and builds pass
- No functional regressions
- Documentation updated if any developer workflow changes
