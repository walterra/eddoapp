git commit just the currently staged files with a proper one-liner commit message. it must be a one-liner without any credit information like "generated with" or "co-authored by".

Note: Husky pre-commit hook runs TypeScript checks, linting, and format checks. If the hook finds problems, fix them before attempting to commit again.
