Then create a briefing that includes: ACTUAL TITLES of 3-5 specific todos I can work on right now, not just counts. For each section, show the top 2-3 SPECIFIC items with clean titles like "- Fix authentication bug" or "- Review project proposal" - DO NOT include IDs or technical identifiers in the display. For calendar appointments, show them with their time prefix (e.g., "- 15:00 Doctor appointment"). Prioritize work tasks Mon-Fri, personal tasks weekends. Make it mobile-friendly with clear, readable action items. FORMATTING RULES FOR THERMAL PRINTER: NO EMOJIS ANYWHERE - they will not print correctly. Use ONLY ASCII characters: letters, numbers, punctuation, basic symbols. Use - or * for bullets, [ ] for unchecked items, [x] for checked items. Keep formatting simple and printer-friendly.

- Send ONLY a brief acknowledgment (under 10 words)
- Examples: "Generating your daily recap..." or "Let me check what you accomplished today..."

- DO NOT include any recap content

**SECOND MESSAGE (WITH MARKER):**
- Start with EXACTLY this marker on its own line: ---RECAP-START---
- Then include the full recap content after the marker
- Today is ${dateStr}. Query for todos completed between ${startTime} and ${endTime}

- Generate an INSIGHTFUL daily recap with SPECIFIC completed tasks:
  ‚Ä¢ ACTUAL TITLES grouped by context (work/personal)
  ‚Ä¢ Clean titles like "[x] Fixed authentication bug" or "[x] Completed project proposal"
  ‚Ä¢ NO IDs or technical identifiers
  ‚Ä¢ Show 5-7 specific accomplishments if available
  ‚Ä¢ For time-tracked items, show duration if meaningful (e.g., "[x] Project X (2h 30m)")
  ‚Ä¢ Highlight productivity patterns and celebrate wins with encouraging tone
  ‚Ä¢ End with brief motivational outlook mentioning 2-3 SPECIFIC next actions for tomorrow
  ‚Ä¢ Make it mobile-friendly with clear, readable accomplishments

**FORMATTING RULES FOR THERMAL PRINTER:**
- NO EMOJIS ANYWHERE (no üéØ ‚úÖ üî• üìÖ ‚è∞ etc.) - they will not print correctly
- Use ONLY ASCII characters: letters, numbers, punctuation, basic symbols
- Section headers: Use plain text with # markdown (e.g., "## Accomplished Today:")
- Checkmarks: Use [x] for completed items
- Bullets: Use - or * for lists
- Keep formatting simple and printer-friendly

CRITICAL: The marker ---RECAP-START--- MUST be at the beginning of the SECOND message ONLY.`;
