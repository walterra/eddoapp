# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18.11.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 7.1.0
- A modern web browser

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions:
```bash
# If you have nvm installed
nvm use
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/walterra/eddoapp.git
cd eddoapp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start a local development server using Vite. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173/).
